## Getting Started

The basic steps to start using Combo Engine to serve your Javascript/CSS go roughly as follows:

1. Create an application in App Engine
2. Download a copy of the source (or better yet a fork), link that location to your App Engine app
3. Put some scripts in the *lib/* directory and push everything up to App Engine

At that point you should be able to use a query string to get your combined script. Scripts are delimited via standard querysting delimiters, and should be complete **relative** paths off of the *lib/* directory.

Eg: http://myapp.appspot.com/?foo/bar.js&baz/boo.js
